# CPSC-332-Project
This is the project repository for a guru/indeed style website, built with php.
This site was designed to run on an aphace web server, with a corresponding SQL database, 
to be hosted through the XAMPP application.

As of writing this readme, the only functionality that is working is the login features, as well as
job post searching and creating.

The unavalaible features are viewing the job post in a seperate page.
